# JTTY transmit manual checks

These checks cover MainWindow, PTT, and backend behavior that is outside the
FIFO unit-test boundary.

- Soundcard: send one JTTY message and verify the full tail plays before PTT drops.
- Soundcard: queue two or three messages rapidly and verify playback is contiguous with PTT held.
- Soundcard: press Stop during playback and verify queued audio is abandoned before PTT drops.
- Soundcard: press Esc before PTT comes up and during playback and verify clean aborts.
- Soundcard: send again after a natural drain and verify a fresh transmit session starts.
- TCI, where available: repeat the same checks and watch for backend enqueue failure warnings.
- Native macros: activate each default JTTY F1-F8 template by keyboard and by
  clicking its button; verify both paths show the same canonical message and
  enqueue the same number of frames.
- Native macros: enter a valid call and serial, send a call-plus-exchange
  template, and verify EOM appears only on the final atom.
- Native macros: make a recognized template's runtime call or serial invalid
  and verify transmission is rejected rather than sent as literal text.
- Literal fallback: customize a function-key template so it no longer matches
  a native form and verify automatic packing preserves its expanded text after
  the selected profile's normalization.
- Free entry: with MyCall K1ABC, compare F1 with typing `CQ K1ABC CQ` and
  selecting Send message; verify the same text and one frame. Repeat with
  `CQ K1ABC CQ CQ K1ABC CQ`, verifying two frames and unchanged spacing.
- External text: send `CQ K1ABC CQ`, `599 123`, `599 MA`, `599 FN42`, and
  `1D EMA` from N1MM/MMTTY; verify each uses one frame and preserves the text.
  With no special activity or with Field Day, send `599 001`, `599 05`, and
  `599 BRUCE`; verify each uses two frames and preserves the text.
- Automatic profile: select RTTY Roundup and send `599 001` and
  `K1ABC 599 001`; verify one and two frames respectively. Verify `599 123`
  and `599 MA` use SERIAL and STATE_PROVINCE rather than generic atoms.
  Verify `599 05` and `599 0123` become `599 005` and `599 123`, each in one
  frame, with the canonical text shown and logged. Verify bare `001` retains
  its spelling and is not inferred as SERIAL. Verify unsupported serial
  tokens (over six digits or above 131071) retain their spelling. Verify a
  message whose serial normalization expands beyond 80 characters is rejected
  rather than truncated. Submit a message, change activity
  before it plays, and verify the submitted message retains its captured
  profile. Repeat through untagged N1MM/MMTTY and customized macro fallback.
- sjtty: compare default and leading `--exchange-profile=rtty-roundup` with
  `599 001`; verify two and one frames. Exercise `unknown` and `field-day`,
  the eight-argument waveform invocation, and rejection of an invalid value.
- Mixed text: send `HI WB9XYZ`, `TEST WB9XYZ`, and `K1ABC HELLO`; verify no
  spaces are inserted or lost where TEXT5 and compact atoms meet. Send a
  registered control phrase alone and embedded in a longer message.
- Queueing: queue two native messages and verify no visible or transmitted
  TEXT5 spacing frame is inserted between them.
- Profile exchange: exercise `%E` with default serial, FIELD_DAY class/section,
  and both RTTY serial and state/province payloads; verify canonical rendering
  and rejection of a payload from the wrong profile.
- Grid macros: verify `%G` renders field-only GRID4 and exact `599 %G` renders
  full-role GRID4; reject malformed locators.
- Settings migration: load unchanged old F2, F6, and F8 defaults using `%N`
  and verify migration to `%E`; verify any edited variant remains literal.
- Windows/N1MM: load `JTTY Messages.mc`, exercise every tagged Run and S&P
  action, and verify the `[[JTTY:ACTION]]` marker is consumed rather than
  transmitted. Reject malformed tags, invalid profile payloads, and unknown
  actions; verify untagged TXTEXT remains literal. Verify an all-rejected
  transaction completes at OFF, and a rejected action followed by a valid
  action still starts and completes only after the accepted audio drains.
- Windows/N1MM: in a two-radio configuration, verify entry-window focus, `!`
  and `{CALL}` expansion, queued-call selection, `{LOGTHENPOP}`, and Run/S&P
  state changes. Before adding a Run F11 call-stacking macro, capture its
  TXTEXT ordering and verify that the leading tag, callsign, and exchange all
  refer to the intended queued station.
